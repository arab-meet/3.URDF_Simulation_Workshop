### contain all data related to the Workshop topic.

## [A - Gazebo](/Gazebo/Gazebo.md)

**`Gazebo`** is a versatile simulation environment widely used in robotics and autonomous systems development. It provides a realistic 3D simulation of environments, allowing engineers and researchers to test robots in virtual scenarios before deploying them in the real world. Gazebo supports complex physics, sensor simulations, and interaction with ROS (Robot Operating System), making it a valuable tool for prototyping and testing robotic applications.

## [B - URDF](URDF/README.md)

The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF), complemented by Xacro, is a cornerstone in robotics, particularly within the ROS ecosystem. It provides a standardized approach to robot modeling, ensuring accurate representation of physical and functional characteristics. Joints are integral to this model, connecting links and defining their movement and interaction. With types like Fixed, Revolute, Continuous, and Prismatic, they dictate the relationship between parent and child links. Plugins, especially Gazebo plugins, further extend these capabilities, allowing for the simulation of complex behaviors and sensor interactions in a virtual environment, which is crucial for testing and development before actual deployment.
